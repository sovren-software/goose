The Code Mode extension enables [Code Mode](/docs/guides/managing-tools/code-mode), a programmatic approach for interacting with MCP tools.

The Code Mode extension is an MCP server that exposes three meta-tools. When Code Mode is enabled, the LLM writes JavaScript code that goose executes using a Deno-based runtime called [Port of Context](https://github.com/AdrianCole/pctx) to discover tools, learn their interfaces, and call them programmatically.

This helps manage context window usage more efficiently when multiple extensions are enabled and when performing workflows with multiple tool calls.

## Configuration

<PlatformExtensionNote defaultEnabled={false} />

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
  <GooseBuiltinInstaller
    extensionName="Code Mode"
    description="Execute JavaScript code to interact with MCP tools efficiently"
  />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">

  1. Run the `configure` command:
  ```sh
  goose configure
  ```

  2. Choose to `Toggle Extensions`
  ```sh
  ┌   goose-configure 
  │
  ◇  What would you like to configure?
  │  Toggle Extensions 
  │
  ◆  Enable extensions: (use "space" to toggle and "enter" to submit)
  // highlight-start    
  │  ● code_execution
  // highlight-end  
  └  Extension settings updated successfully
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example Usage

In this example, we'll ask goose to compile a report that requires multiple tool calls.

### goose Prompt

```
Create a LOG.md file with the current git branch, last 3 commits, and the version from package.json
```

### goose Output

:::note Desktop
I'll help you create a LOG.md file with the git branch, last 3 commits, and version from package.json. Let me gather all this information in one operation.

`Execute Code code: import { shell, text_editor } from "developer" ...`

Let me check the package.json path first:

`Execute Code code: import { shell, text_editor } from "developer" ...`

Perfect! I've created the **LOG.md** file with:

- ✅ **Current git branch**
- ✅ **Last 3 commits** (with hash, message, author, and relative time)
- ✅ **Version** from ui/desktop/package.json

The file has been saved to the root directory as `LOG.md`.
