## Example Usage

Neighborhood is most powerful when goose combines it with context from your day — your schedule, your goals, your dietary needs. Instead of just searching for food, you can ask goose to reason about what to eat based on what you're doing.

### Finding a meal that fits your activity

#### goose Prompt
```
Use the neighborhood extension for this. I'm looking to get lunch today.
I'm at 375 W Broadway in New York. I'm playing tennis later tonight.
Could you suggest some options so I can play well?
```

#### goose Output

```
Here are some restaurants near 375 W Broadway in SoHo! For pre-tennis fuel,
I'd recommend these options:

Best picks for athletic performance:

Kale & Things - Perfect for a healthy, nutrient-dense meal with greens and
lean proteins to give you sustained energy without feeling heavy

Simply Natural Grill House NY (684 Broadway) - Great for grilled proteins
and wholesome meals that'll fuel your game

Ba'al Falafel (71 Sullivan St) - Mediterranean food with falafel, hummus,
and fresh veggies provides good carbs and protein

Tips for eating before tennis:

- Eat 2-3 hours before playing to allow digestion
- Focus on complex carbs + lean protein (avoid heavy, fatty foods)
- Stay hydrated - consider grabbing a drink from Steam & Sip or Drip Drop Café

Would you like me to pull up the menu for any of these restaurants so you can
see what they offer? Kale & Things sounds like it could be ideal for your
pre-match meal!
```

### More Prompt Ideas

Try combining Neighborhood with other goose extensions for even more useful workflows:

- **Pair with your calendar:** *"Check my calendar for today and find somewhere I can grab a quick pickup lunch before my 1pm meeting. I'm near Union Square."*
- **Track what you eat:** *"Order me a chicken bowl from that place on Sullivan St, and log the macros to my food diary."*
- **Plan for a group:** *"I'm meeting 3 friends near Bryant Park tonight. Find somewhere with good vegetarian options that's not too loud."*
